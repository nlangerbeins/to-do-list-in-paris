        description: `The Eiffel Tower isn't just a symbol of Paris but a symbol for all of France. There’s no mistaking it: the Eiffel Tower rips through the air like a giant. This impressive symbol of France can be seen from almost anywhere in the city. Reigning 324 meters high, the iron tower has dominated the Parisian horizon ever since the 1889 Universal Exhibition. Unbeatable sensations kick in as soon as you start climbing the Eiffel Tower. Seven million visitors make the trip every year, climbing its three levels to get to the very top. Don’t forget that the Eiffel Tower takes on a different person at night.`,

        description: `Rising high above Paris, the Sacré-Coeur (meaning "Sacred Heart") looks more like a white castle than a basilica – but that's what it is. Towering over the eclectic neighborhood of Montmartre (once a hangout for Paris' bohemian crowd), this Roman-Byzantine masterpiece is easily recognized by its ornate ivory domes. As blanched as it may appear on the outside, the basilica's interior is a sight worth beholding: The ceilings glitter with France's largest mosaic, which depicts Jesus rising alongside the Virgin Mary and Joan of Arc. `,

By the way, both Renoir and Van Gogh rolled up their painting frock sleeves at the Tertre Square. Montmartre is more than just painters; it’s a cultural and gastronomic hotbed with its own authentic charm. Steep streets wind their way past vine-covered homes and hidden staircases lead to quaint, cobblestone squares. This is Montmartre’s undeniable charm. `,

Once onboard navigating past monuments and buildings, you’ll be able to fully enjoy your time on the Seine. The Seine has always been and forever will be the artery that runs through the heart of Paris. Geographically speaking, the river is the capital’s central axis and has always played a major role in Paris’s history. Identified as a territorial and economic advantage, the Seine has accompanied -- if not at times led -- Paris’s growth. Several landmarks throughout the city attest to this rich past.`,

The cathedral has been a firsthand witness to several historical events such as the arrival of the Holy Crown in 1239, the exoneration of Joan of Arc in 1456 and the coronation of Napoléon I in 1804. Its spectacular rose windows, precious objects and magnificent bells are all symbols of this architectural masterpiece. With more than 20 million visitors a year, Notre-Dame used to be the most visited monument, free to the public, in both Paris and Europe. Let's hope that its restoration will soon allow us to enjoy its beauty again.`,

The 13th century Philippe Auguste fort that surrounds the museum was reorganized until becoming the royal residence for several centuries. Today, the immensity of the Louvre is mind-boggling: it has been estimated that nine months are needed to see each and every work of art on display. The Louvre is indeed one of the world’s biggest museum; its exhibition surface area of 18 acres displays 38,000 works of art out of the 460,000 that the museum possesses within its walls.`,
